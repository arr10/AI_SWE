      "answer": "E",
      "rationale": "If the ten books were all different, the arrangements would be (10!), a very big number. Because we have repeats of identical copies, not all 10! arrangements will be unique. For a subset of k identical members, those k members could be interchanged in k! orders, and the resulting arrangements would be the same, so we have to divide by k! to remove repetitions. In this example, we need to divide 10! by 4! and 3! and 2!:\n10!/4!3!2!=12600\nAnswer : E"

If 32,000 copies of the paper cover version were sold at $0.20 each and 15,000 copies of the hardcover version were sold at $0.40 each, how much did the author earn?",
      "answer": "1104",
      "reasoning": "The total earnings for the paper cover version were $0.20 x 32 000 = $<<0.20*32000=6400>>6,400.\nSo, the author earned $6,400 x 6/100 = $384 from the paper cover version.\nThe total earnings for the hardcover version were $0.40 x 15,000 = $<<0.40*15000=6000>>6,000.\nSo, the author earned $6,000 x 12/100 = $<<6000*12/100=720>>720 from the hardcover version.\nTherefore, the author earned a total of $384 + $720 = $<<384+720=1104>>1104.\n"

      "reasoning": "The number of the increase in chicken after 9 years is 150 * 9 = <<150*9=1350>>1350.\nSo the total number of the chicken in Michael's farm will be 550 + 1350 = <<550+1350=1900>>1900.\n"

      "answer": "32000",
      "reasoning": "There are 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 members joining\nSo the cost is 4*4000=$<<4*4000=16000>>16,000 to join\nThe monthly fee comes out to 1000*12=$<<1000*12=12000>>12,000 per person per year\nSo that is 12000*4=$<<12000*4=48000>>48,000\nSo the total cost is 16,000+48,000=$<<16000+48000=64000>>64,000\nSo John pays 64000/2=$<<64000/2=32000>>32,000\n"

If 50000 more people viewed the video after another two days, determine the number of views the video had gained on Youtube?",
      "answer": "94000",
      "reasoning": "If the number of views on the first day was 4000, the video's views on Youtube increased by 10*4000= 40000 after four days.\nThe total number of views of the video on Youtube after four days was 40000+4000 = <<40000+4000=44000>>44000\nIf 50000 more people viewed the video, the total number of views that the Youtube video had is 44000+50000 = 94000\n"

      "reasoning": "First find the total number of calories in the pancakes: 6 pancakes * 120 calories/pancake = <<6*120=720>>720 calories\nThen find the total number of calories in the bacon: 2 strips * 100 calories/strip = <<2*100=200>>200 calories\nThen add the number of calories in each food to find the total number of calories: 720 calories + 200 calories + 200 calories = <<720+200+200=1120>>1120 calories\n"
