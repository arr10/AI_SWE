      "question": "Sid takes $48 with him on a shopping trip to the mall.  He spent some of his money on computer accessories and another $8 on snacks. After these purchases, he only has $4 more than half of his original money left. How much did he spend on computer accessories?",
      "answer": "12",
      "reasoning": "Half of Sid's original money is $48/2 = $<<48/2=24>>24.\nSid has only $24 + $4 = $<<24+4=28>>28 left after his purchases.\nHe had $28 + $8 = $<<28+8=36>>36 before he spent $8 on snacks.\nSo, Sid spent $48 - $36 = $<<48-36=12>>12 on computer accessories.\n"

      "answer": "10",
      "reasoning": "Dora made 8 cupcakes per hour for 5 hours for a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 cupcakes\nBetty took a 2-hour break so she spent 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3 hours making cupcakes\nBetty made 10 cupcakes per hour for 3 hours for a total of 10*3 = <<10*3=30>>30 cupcakes\nThe difference between the number of cupcakes they made is 40-30 = <<40-30=10>>10 cupcakes\n"

      "question": "There is a massive rainstorm lasting 4 days.  There is an area that collects water to prevent flooding in the area.  It ends up overflowing on the 4th day.  The area can hold the equivalent of 6 feet of rain.  It can also drain out the equivalent of 3 inches of rain per day to the nearby river without causing problems.  The first day it rained 10 inches.  The second day it rained twice that much.  On the third day, it rained 50% more than the second day.  It flooded the fourth day before getting a chance to do any of the draining.  What is the minimum amount it rained on the fourth day?",
      "answer": "21",
      "reasoning": "The second day it rained 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 inches\nOn the third day it rained 20*1.5=<<20*1.5=30>>30 inches\nSo in the first 3 days, it rained 10+20+30=<<10+20+30=60>>60 inches\nIt drained 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 days\nSo it drained 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 inches\nThat means on the start of the fourth day, there were 60-9=<<60-9=51>>51 inches in the pond\nThe area can hold 6*12=<<6*12=72>>72 inches\nSo it rained at least 72-51=<<72-51=21>>21 inches\n"

      "answer": "120",
      "reasoning": "First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km\nThen multiply the number of kilometers she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer to find the total amount of water she needs: 60 ml/km * 2 km = <<60*2=120>>120 ml\n"
